# Fix Audit Issues
On each PR, `pnpm audit` is used to detect [CVEs](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-cve). The GitHub Actions Workflow will fail if any CVEs >= moderate severity are found by running the command `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate`. If the dependency is a direct dependency of your project, you should try to [update dependencies](#update-dependencies). You can learn why a dependency is in your project (dependency hierarchy) with `pnpm why <package-name>`. If the dependency is a transitive dependency (dependency of dependency), you'll need to use PNPM's [pnpm.overrides feature](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) by adding to the `package.json#pnpm.overrides` object a key/value pair like: `"<package-name>@<vulnerable-version>": "<patched-version>"`. Then run `pnpm i` to update your dependencies.

Periodically, `pnpm.overrides` should be cleaned up as libraries overtime will update to patched version of packages.

If there is no patched version of the library and you can safely ignore the CVE, you can add it to `pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreCves`.
