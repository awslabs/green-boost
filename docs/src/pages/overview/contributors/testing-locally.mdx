# Testing Locally

To develop `gboost-ui` or `gboost-infra` or `gboost-common` in your Green Boost application repository (created with `gboost create`), run `pnpm add ../path/to/gboost/packages/gboost-*` replacing the path with the path to wherever the package is locally. This will change your package.json.

Instructions below allow you to edit .ts files and test out your changes without having to compile to .js each time you make a change.

### gboost-ui

After running `pnpm add ../path/to/gboost/packages/gboost-ui` in your GB app ui folder, you'll need to restart the Vite dev server.

For any library used in `gboost-ui` and the consuming package (ui folder), you'll want to add that library to Vite's [resolve.dedupe](https://vitejs.dev/config/#resolve-dedupe) configuration parameter. See an explanation [here](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/duplicate-dependencies-npm-link/). Here is an inexhaustive list: `["aws-amplify", "@aws-amplify/ui-react", "graphql", "graphql-tag", "react", "react-dom", "react-icons", "react-router-dom", "@vanilla-extract/css"]`

### gboost

Install `vite-node` globally with `pnpm add -g vite-node`. Then you can run the CLI source (TS files) with: `vite-node --options.deps.inline="@aws-sdk/util-user-agent-node" ../path/to/green-boost/packages/gboost/src/index.ts -- <command>`. You can remove `--options.deps.inline="@aws-sdk/util-user-agent-node"` once [this issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/3622) is resolved.

### gboost-infra

After running `pnpm add ../path/to/gboost/packages/gboost-infra` in your GB app infra folder you'll have 2 instances of `aws-cdk-lib` and `cdk-nag`. One in your project and one in the green-boost repository. This causes an issue for `cdk-nag` because it uses `instanceof` comparisons on classes to conditionally check if resources adhere to requirements. See more [here](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag/issues/1219). To get around this, we'll use Vite's `resolve.dedupe` [configuration feature](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#resolve-dedupe). Steps:
- In infra folder run: `pnpm add -D vite vite-node`
- Add vite.config.ts
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    dedupe: ["aws-cdk-lib", "cdk-nag"],
  },
});
```
- Change cdk.json#app to `"/path/to/your/app/infra/node_modules/.bin/vite-node src/local-app.ts"`
- `cdk synth "**"`. Now only 1 version of those libraries will be used when synthesizing your app.

Note: you'll need to run `pnpm build` within green-boost/packages/gboost-infra if using constructs that rely on built code like custom resources.
