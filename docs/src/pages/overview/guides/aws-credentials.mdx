# AWS Credentials
## The Problem
The simplest way to use [AWS Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html) (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, ...) is to copy and paste them from your provider (like IAM Identity Center) into your shell. However, what happens when you need to start a new shell process (new terminal tab) and still need your AWS credentials? You'll need to copy and paste them from your provider again ðŸ™„.
## AWS CLI
In order to persist credentials between shell processes, you can use the ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config files which are automatically recognized by the AWS CLI, SDKs, and CDK.
<Callout type="info">
  AWS recommends using temporary credentials using IAM Roles. Try to avoid using long-lived IAM User credentials.
</Callout>
You can persist credentials exported into your terminal with the following commands:
```bash copy
aws configure set aws_access_key_id "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
aws configure set aws_session_token "$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN"
```
Checkout your ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config to confirm the credentials have been saved:
```bash copy
cat ~/.aws/credentials
```
This works, but what if you're switching between multiple AWS accounts and want to save different sets of credentials? We need a way to separate and identify sets of credentials. This is what the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is for. You can append `--profile "$AWS_PROFILE"` to each of the previous `aws configure set...` commands with an exported `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to identify sets of credentials.
## Alias
To make the previous commands easier to run, you can create an alias, `uac` (**u**pdate **a**ws **c**redentials), in your shell configuration file (.zschrc, ...) like below:
```bash copy filename=".zshrc"
alias uac='(
  aws configure set aws_access_key_id "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" --profile "$AWS_PROFILE"
  aws configure set aws_secret_access_key "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" --profile "$AWS_PROFILE"
  aws configure set aws_session_token "$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN" --profile "$AWS_PROFILE"
  echo "AWS Credentials Updated âœ…"
)'
```
Now, with your AWS credentials and `AWS_PROFILE` in your shell process, you can simply run `uac` and your AWS credentials will be persisted but you'll need to ensure the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is set so that AWS tools know which persisted credentials to use. This is where [direnv](https://direnv.net/) can help.
## direnv
`direnv` is an extension for your shell that loads and unloads environment variables in your current shell based on your current working directory. This means you can add a `.envrc` file at the root of your monorepo that looks like:
``` bash copy filename=".envrc"
export AWS_PROFILE=my-profile
```
Then run `direnv allow{:bash}` and now `AWS_PROFILE` will be set in any new shell process created within your monorepo. Prove this by running `printenv | grep AWS{:bash}`.
You'll notice in `gboost create{:bash}` templates, there are .envrc files already setup for you with commonly needed environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE`. We also include DB related environment variables so you easily connect to your DB locally. You're welcome to set other environment variables you commonly need within your .envrc file.
