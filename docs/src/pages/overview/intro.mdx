## Motivation
Building a web app on AWS can feel daunting. There are many design decisions to make. While developing, there can be a lot of setup and boilerplate code. [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/) has experience building hundreds of web apps and we've learned some lessons along the way. We wanted to share with you these best practices while also providing an easy way to get started. That's why we built Green Boost.
