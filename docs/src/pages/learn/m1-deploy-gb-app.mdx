# Module 1: Deploy Green Boost Template App

Welcome to Module 1. In this module you will deploy a Green Boost web app starting from the Aurora PostgreSQL Template.

## Learn

1. Read through the [Overview](../overview/intro) docs.
2. Review the Green Boost [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/48/views/7) to see what's on the road map.

## Apply

### M1.1 - Deploy the Aurora PostgreSQL Template.
1. Follow [prerequisites](../overview/prereqs).
2. Run below commands:
```bash
pnpm add -g gboost
pnpm env use --global 18
gboost create
cd <your-directory>
pnpm i
cd infra
pnpm deploy:local
```
### M1.2 - Resources & Constructs
While you're waiting (~20 minutes) for your CloudFormation stacks to deploy, checkout the resources in each stack being deployed. What resources are there? Which resources map to which constructs within the infrastructure code that `gboost create{:bash}` generated? See infrastructure code in `infra/src/app/**`.

### M1.3 - Visit Web App
View your newly deployed web app at the CloudFront URL printed by the `pnpm deploy:local{:bash}` command.
- Your UI stack create an output with the CloudFront URL that will look something like: `myapp5stickbui9C39A55A.CloudFrontDomainName = d1q16n5pof924c.cloudfront.net` which contains the URL.

### M1.4 - Monitor Dashboard
View your CloudWatch Monitoring Dashboard in the AWS Console. Which resources are being monitored? What thresholds were set for alarms?

### M1.5 - Scan Code
Review the other folders generated by `gboost create{:bash}`. You'll be working more with them in the next modules.
