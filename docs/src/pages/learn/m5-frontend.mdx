### M4.1 - Run The Dev Server
With your DB port forwarded to your local machine as you learned in the previous [module](./m4-backend#m42---db-gui), let's run the Next.js local development server.
- Within the `ui/` folder, run `pnpm dev`.
- Visit http://localhost:3000 and interact with your web app locally!
- Try changing the color of the app bar by updating `theme.colorSchemes.light.palette.primary.main{:ts}` from `colors.lagoon{:ts}` to `colors.carrot{:ts}` in `ui/src/components/theme/theme.tsx`. Save the file and then watch the update happen in your browser
