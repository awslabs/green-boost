# Module 7: Clean Code architecture
Green Boost repositories organize code such that it is modular, adaptable, and maintainable. The code organization techniques used draw upon ideas from Domain Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, and Vertical Slice Architecture.

## Learn
- Read Serverless Clean Architecture & Code with Domain-Driven Design Articles
  - Note, these articles have enterprise use cases in mind. The GB app you created in week 1 is meant to be approachable so you won't see all of these concepts within the GB /core workspace
  - Read [Part 1: Intro, What, Why](https://blog.serverlessadvocate.com/serverless-clean-architecture-code-with-domain-driven-design-852796846d28). Focus on hexagonal and onion architecture concepts
  - Scan [Part 2: Aggregates, Value Objects, Events](https://blog.serverlessadvocate.com/serverless-clean-architecture-code-with-domain-driven-design-part-2-9ad0882ff85b)
  - Scan [Part 3: DDD](https://blog.serverlessadvocate.com/serverless-architecture-layers-ddd-part-3-the-domain-layer-43ffce28806f)
  - Scan [Part 4: The Data Layer](https://blog.serverlessadvocate.com/serverless-architecture-layers-ddd-part-4-the-data-layer-8d27b5889034)
- The 4 part series you just read sets up a lot of boilerplate code designed to help you organize an enterprise grade app with DDD in mind. But what if you're building a simpler app?
